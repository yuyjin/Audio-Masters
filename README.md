Abstract

In our project, we explored a technique for recognizing individuals based on their voices, employing a specific method known as the LBG algorithm. Our aim was to identify and map unique voice features, utilizing Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as the primary tool for this task.

The process began with the initial preparation of voice recordings, which involved cleaning and structuring the data through segmentation and the application of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Following this, the LBG algorithm was implemented to categorize the voice data into distinct groups, according to their shared characteristics. This categorization facilitated the creation of a distinctive codebook for each participant, effectively capturing the essence of each individual's voice.

To evaluate the efficacy of our system, we conducted tests using 16 voice samples collected during class sessions. Impressively, our system achieved successful identification for 9 of these samples. This outcome notably surpasses the average human recognition rate, which typically stands at about 50%, demonstrating the potential of our approach in the field of voice recognition.
