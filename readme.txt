Welcome to Yuyang Jin and Joey Kouryâ€™s EEC 201 Final Project.  
Our final project was to create a speaker recognition system

In our main repository, you will find a .m file called main_final.m, and another called main_plots.m
main_final.m is our final working code.
main_plots.m is not our entire code, but it is part of it, along with some simplifications, to show some initial plots.

Please also download files disteu.m, melfb.m, and mfcc_test.m, as our main script references those files.
